### Summary: Docker-in-Docker (DinD) in CI Pipeline

**Scenario:** Using Docker-in-Docker in a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline, such as with Jenkins.

**Setup:**

1. **Jenkins Master Container:** Runs Jenkins master server.
2. **Jenkins Agent Container:** Runs Jenkins agents with Docker CLI tools.
3. **Docker Socket Mount:** Mount Docker socket from host to agent container to execute Docker commands.

**Pipeline Stages:**

- **Build:** Build Docker image.
- **Test:** Run tests inside Docker container.
- **Deploy:** Push Docker image to registry.

**Benefits:**

- **Isolation:** Each build runs in an isolated environment.
- **Consistency:** Ensures consistent build environments.
- **Flexibility:** Allows complex CI/CD workflows within Docker containers.
